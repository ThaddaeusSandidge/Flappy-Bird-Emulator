## My Rendition of Flappy Bird

This project allowed me to implement object oriented programming as well as apply my knowledge of DSA, implementing the oncoming pipes through the use of a Linked List.

Instructions:
1. Clone repo
2. Run FlappyFrame.java (make sure you have JavaFX installed in your environment)
3. Enjoy!
